If memory is an issue and you have a limited space for memory the recommendation would be exhaustive key search as the test for the keys are not saved. Though this may take a bit more time you are able to save on memory space. If time is an issue and you have the available memory allocation, a meet-in-the-middle attack would be the better option as it takes less time due to the fact that it has less operations and stores more in the memory.\n",
